# isPalindrome-site
My first mini project a responsive site to check if a word, number, phrase is a palindrome using html css js and adobe xd. 
Made a mockup of my site using adobe xd so i could use as a reference. Created html file and made the bones of the site. Made a css file and worked my way to the mockup. Made a responsive site using media queries. Made the function to check for palindrome. Made the site active using the DOM. Learned a lot doing this project: Better understanding of how to create a site from the ground up. Better understanding of the css grid and the box concept.
